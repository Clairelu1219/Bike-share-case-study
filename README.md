# Cyclistic bike-share Case Study with R

### Introduction
This is my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course case study project.
<br>🛠️ Analysis tool: R programming language(RStudio) to do statistical analysis and data visualizations.</br>

### Scenario
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
